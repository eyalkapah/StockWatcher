# StockWatcher
<b>WPF on .NET Framework application</b>

Welcome! This is the repository for Stock Watcher project.
This application developed using WPF C# Technology under .NET Framework for tutorial purposes.

StockWatcher application shows updated stock information straight from Yahoo Finance API.
Although it's .NET Framework based, I combined new libraries for learning and to make things a bit more interesting.

Some key features the application has:
* Many WPF features such as XAML, converters, Custom controls and more...
* Pure MVVM architecture with the most recent Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm
* Login form
* Registration form
* form validation using FluentValidation 
* Full dependency injection support
* Logging support using Serilog
* Database based on SQL
* Written stored procedures
* Querying database using Dapper
* Candle stick chart using FancyCandels
* Writing API for yahoo finance
* Theme support
* Http client communication
* Json serialization
* Tests using MSTests
